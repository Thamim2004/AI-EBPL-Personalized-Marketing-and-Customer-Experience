AI-EBPL: Personalized Marketing and Customer Experience
AI-EBPL is an intelligent marketing solution designed to enhance customer engagement and conversion through real-time behavioral analysis and age-based profiling. By using computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system predicts the age group and emotional state of a user to deliver targeted advertisements and content—offering a smarter, more personalized customer experience.

1.Features:

Real-Time Age Detection
Detects customer age groups from camera input using deep learning.

Emotion Recognition
Analyzes customer emotions to fine-tune content delivery.

Personalized Advertisement Display
Dynamically selects and shows ads based on detected age/emotion.

Embedded System Deployment
Optimized for low-cost devices like Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.

Offline Processing
Ensures data privacy by processing everything locally without cloud dependency.

Modular Design
Easily extendable to include gender detection, product interest scoring, or face recognition.

2.Technology Used:

Python – Core programming language

OpenCV – Image processing and real-time camera integration

TensorFlow / Keras – Deep learning models for age and emotion detection

DeepFace – Facial analysis for age, gender, and emotion

Flask / Streamlit (optional) – For UI integration

Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano – Embedded hardware for on-edge inference

3.How It Works:

Capture Input:
The camera captures a real-time image of the person.

Face Detection & Analysis:
DeepFace is used to detect the face and analyze age, gender, and emotion.

Age Group Classification:
The predicted age is mapped to predefined age brackets (e.g., child, teen, adult, senior).

Emotion Detection:
Dominant emotion is extracted from the face.

Ad Recommendation Engine:
A decision tree maps age group + emotion to a specific marketing message or ad.

Display Output:
The ad is displayed instantly on a connected screen for the user.

Data Collection
Facial Images:
The system processes real-time images using a webcam but does not store any facial data.

Demographic Grouping:
Age is estimated and categorized into groups:
Child (0–12), Teen (13–19), Adult (20–59), Senior (60+)

Emotion Metrics:
Common emotions like happy, sad, angry, neutral are used to refine ad relevance.

Privacy Assurance:
All analysis is done locally. No user data is transmitted or stored, ensuring GDPR compliance and user trust.

4.Usage:

Clone the repository

Install dependencies:
pip install deepface opencv-python matplotlib
